# SHA256-xv6Implementation

This repository contains three implementations of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm in the xv6 operating system environment. 
Each implementation demonstrates a unique approach to integrating and executing SHA-256: in kernel space, user space, and via system calls. 
The project provides insights into each method's performance, memory usage, and security considerations.

This project was developed as part of a operating systems course to explore cryptographic integration in operating systems.
